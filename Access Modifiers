Access modifiers help to restrict the scope.
Can be applied to class, variable, method, constructor too

Private : Can not be applied to top level classes. Can only be applied to nested  classes.The methods or
data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared.

Protected :

Default : having default access modifiers are accessible only within the same package.

Public : It has the widest scope among all the access modifiers, classes , methods declared as public can be acceessed from anywhere of the program.



Lastly in java we use package to group all the related classes.
