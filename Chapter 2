OOP mein there are 4 fundamental concepts 

-abstraction
-polymorphism
-inheritance
-encapsulation

* Abstraction: Abstraction ka matlab he to only concentrate on the things which are important for us. Like medicines, we only prefer to know when to take it, we usually dont dig
             into its pharmaceutical details. 

              It helps us manage complexity.

              Abstraction helps you identify and focus on the essential characteristics or attributes of an object or system.
              For a car, the relevant attributes might include speed, direction, and fuel level.


* Inheritance:   Inheritance ka matlab kese 1 class dosri class ke (attributes and methods) ko inherit karke use karsakti he. This helps us not to rewrite our code
                again and again. This way we can also form a hierarchy.

                A new sub class can inherit all the attributes of all of its ancestor classes. While having new unique attributes.  


*Polymorphism: Poly means many, and morphisms mean forms. so this new word means many forms. When we make a sub class, it inherits all the attributes and  methods.
              The method will be used as defined in the parent class. So all subclasses will have the same method usage as the parent class.However we can change the 
              way we use the method for each class by specifying . SO the name of the method will be same but it will be used differently by each class.

              Polymorphism refers to the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method, depending on the type of object that is
              passed to the method.
